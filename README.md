# NixProject By Sotiris Zannetos
Nixe Clock Project Including Electronics, Software and 3d Designing for Enclosure

By looking at the Nixie Datasheet we know that each tube requires 10 different Inputs to turn each digit on(Will not be using the commas). For this clock I will be using the classic IN-14 Tube.

My MCU of choice is the ATmega328P which is a very popular choice that is also using in Arduino devices, it has a very well established documentation and support and can also be programmed using the Arduino IDE.
